This is frontend part of project created in React for passing subject during Bachelor studies in my University.
Backend part was create by my groupmates

This is our approach to store managment system in shops. Instead of using scanners and other hardware
we can possibly use computer, mobile and this application.

###

Our small mobile application consists of camera and few buttons. We are using Google Vision API
which scans barcode, then on frontend we have long-polling which constatly sends request to our server and retrives new items.

Also, there is implemented so-called Inventory Managment system. There you can manage items which were scanned by mobile application.
Therefore, our mobile application is used in Billing system for cashiers and in Inventory Managment system for managers.
